# # IMGD 4000 - Development Portfolio
You may optionally submit a development portfolio for 15% of your final grade. This portfolio should outline, in detail, your development  work on your group project. Please describe:

1. Your role in the project  
2. The challenges you faced
3. How you overcame those challenges, including specific APIs used and code fragments (both Blueprints and C++)
4. An architectural diagram(s) that roughly portrays the architecture of your final project and then shows the design of your specific parts in more detail. This might include UML, control flow diagram, networking diagrams etc.
5. Lessons learned: how should students facing similar challenges in the future tackle the problems you faced?
6. Describe your version control choice, and your experience with it.

The goal is to convey what you personally were able to accomplish and learn in the project, and to help future students who might face similar challenges. 

My preferred submission format for the document is Markdown via GitHub Pages, but you may also post it via HTML on your personal website. Please submit this to me by the end of course via a DM in Slack.
