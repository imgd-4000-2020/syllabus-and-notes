# Beta Presentation and Release – GROUP – Wednesday, May 13th 
The final version of your game in this course is a "beta" release. It should have most bugs fixed, and have
reasonable game balance. All art assets should be in place and functional and all the tech features
should be functional. Your final presentation will be held via Zoom and should be no more than 10 minutes in length.

You will have 10 minutes for your presentation plus two minutes for questions from class
and professors. You will start by clicking on your website link for your presentation slides (PDF, Google or PowerPoint) and for your demonstration video (see below).

Presentations should then move to an introduction of the team and members, then provide a high concept of the game, and a summary of the major art and technical features.

Presentations should include an approximately 3-minute demonstration video from a link on your website, which demonstrates all of the technical and gameplay aspects of the game. It will probably be useful to combine multiple gameplay cuts. Do not try to demonstrate your game live!

Screen capture videos can be easily created using any one of a number of free tools, such as [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com). (This is a good skill
to learn, if you don't already know how to do so.) The video can be narrated or you can provide the
narration live. The files can be hosted on Google Drive or other similar services.

Every member of your team should talk. Arrangements should be made in advance as to which parts of
the presentation will be given by each team member.

Your presentation will be ended after 10 minutes, regardless of whether you have covered everything or
not (and your grade may therefore suffer). Plan your presentations accordingly. Most important is to
practice, many times, to be sure you have the content, timing and transitions down.

Also:

Don't forget the opening/splash screen. Don't forget credits.
Don't forget directions to play (in game, not just in the documentation).

To determine your final grade, the faculty will also play your game themselves by clicking on the link you provide on your website, or via compiling your source code. Please provide a revision number (Perforce) or a link to a commit (Git) that you would like us to compile and be prepared to help address any compiilation issues that might arise.
